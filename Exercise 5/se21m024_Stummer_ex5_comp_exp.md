# Algorithms

todo: change all below

The library <i>Surprise</i> (https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) including the example code of its online documentation was used to parameterize and train the algorithms as well as measuring their accuracy reached.<br>
These three clustering algorithms were chosen based on the assignments requirements:

- User Based Filtering (k-NN with means)
- Item Based Filtering (k-NN with means)
- Co-clustering
